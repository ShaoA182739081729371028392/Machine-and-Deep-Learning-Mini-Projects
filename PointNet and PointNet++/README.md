This is the jupyter notebook where I experimented with Object Part Segmentation(shapeNet) and Classification(ModelNet10) using the baseline PointNet and PointNet ++
The results were varied, with the object part segmentation working slightly better.
Also, some models were undertrained as Colab was running out of NoteBook time(ex. PointNet++ Object Part Segmentation)
