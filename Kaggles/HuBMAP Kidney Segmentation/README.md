This Repo captures the details of how I created a Modified UNet + FPN and ASPP segmentation model to identify abnormalities in kidneys. 
I modified almost everything since my last commit and was able to get top 70 Public LB as the time of this commit.
- Since the competition is ending in 14 days, I suspect this will quickly drop to 100 or so by the end.

Single Fold 512x512 EffNet Unet:
- 93.3LB and 93.7CV
