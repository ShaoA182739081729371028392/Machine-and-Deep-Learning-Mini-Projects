The Coleridge Dataset estimation challenge was very difficult. In total, I didn't place well but learned a lot about NLP. Ultimately, String matching worked in this challenge, which was disappointing.

Models Tried:
- MLM Model
- Language Model(ROBERTA + XLNET)
- NER SYSTEM
- QA SYSTEM

Public: 0.4 LB
Private: 0.1 LB, it seemed that neural network based methods overfitted.
