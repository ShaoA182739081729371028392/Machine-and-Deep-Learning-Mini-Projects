Multi Fold Training of models on Plant Pathology Challenge. 3 Folds using efficientNetb4_noisy student and 1 fold on MobileNetv3.

MobileNetv3: 92% Accuracy, 0.8 F1 score
Fold1: 94% accuracy, 0.85 F1
Fold2: 93.6% accuracy, 0.84 F1
Fold3: 94% accuracy, 0.86 F1

There seems to be a problem with the test dataset on this challenge, as there is a massive CV-LB discrepancy.
