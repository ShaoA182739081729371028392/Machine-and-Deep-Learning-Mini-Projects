This Notebook has great accuracy on the UCF101 Dataset, achieving 15/16 on the test set.
It starts off with a baseline of a simple 2D CNN classifier and then moves onto the new, VTN or Video Transformer network

The visual transformer state_dict is too large to be uploaded to GitHub(>25 mB), so it is linked here to GDrive.
