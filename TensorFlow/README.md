I have always been a PyTorch developer, and always wanted to learn TensorFlow, since it provides a bit more functionality and has more options for deployment.
For instance, I wanted to begin developing with Federated Learning, and deploying on Mobile Devices, which is something that PyTorch doesn't allow for.
Thus, this series of notebooks explores my TensorFlow journey, from basic MNIST to more complicated models.
